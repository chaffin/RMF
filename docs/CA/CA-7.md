# CA-7 Continuous Monitoring

`[The Facility]` implements an Information System Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) program developed at the Tier 3, information system level, by incorporating System-Level Continuous Monitoring (SLCM) step tasks outlined in the DAAPM.[^1]

The ISSM/ISSO with assistance from the ISO, FSO, and other system stakeholders are responsible for the following monitoring tasks denoted by an ''M'' designator:

**M-1:** The cyber integration team described in [CA-1](./CA-1)(a.1), monitors all technical, management, and operational security controls employed within and inherited by the information system;

**M-2:** An ongoing assessment of control effectiveness is conducted utilizing the assessment methods outlined in the below section (d).  

**M-3:** Assessed output data are analyzed and appropriately responded to which includes one or more of the following tasks; 

**M-4:** Ensure the system security documentation (RAR, SSP, POA&M) are updated. 

**M-5:** ISSM reports results to the ISSP/SCA. 

**M-6:** Proper decommission (*disposal*) plans are implemented and. 

**M-7:** Make live updates within eMASS or Security Control Traceability Matrix (SCTM).[^2]  

The continuous monitoring program includes: ([[CCI-000274]])

a. The establishment of security control numbers as the metrics to be monitored; ([[CCI-002087]])

b. The established <abbr title="Defense">[DCSA]</abbr> monitoring frequencies as defined in DAAPM Appendix A for each security control; ([[CCI-002088]], [[CCI-002089]])

c. Ongoing security control assessments in accordance with [[CA-2]], and continuous monitoring strategy (M-1), as well as using independent assessors in [[CA-7(1)]]; ([[CCI-000279]])

d. Ongoing security status monitoring of metrics defined in [[CA-7]] (a) utilizing the below assessment methods: ([[CCI-002090]])

`ASSESS:TEST`
Technical and Physical controls (e.g.; access, alarms, IS Configuration settings, Group/Local Policies) are assessed, and/or tested for compliance.

`AUDIT:ANALYZE`
Records, Logs (e.g.; training records, maintenance records, visitor logs, and audit logs) are audited and analyzed for completeness with no gaps or missing entries for compliance. 

`EXAMINE:REVIEW`
Documents and Documentation (e.g.; Policy, MOU/MOA, Inventories, Baselines, Scans and STIG results) are examined and reviewed for relevance and accuracy.

`INTERVIEW:OBSERVE`
Processes and Procedures (e.g.; Media Protection, Escorting, Couriers, Opening/Closing, etc.) are observed with selected individuals interviewed. 

e. Correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring task ''M-3'' are reported to the ISSM utilizing an  information system continuous monitoring checklist;{{3}} ([[CCI-002091]])

f. Response actions to address the results of the analyzed security-related information requires security documentation is updated and maintained in accordance with task ''M-4'', and security status reports are provided on the security posture to the appropriate officials in accordance with one or more of the following tasks ''M-5'', ''M-6'', ''M-7'' via eMASS; email and/or telephone for information systems outside eMASS; and ([[CCI-002092]])

g. The security status of specific program and the information system are reported to the ISSP/SCA, KMPs and appropriate Cyber Integration Team members immediately for any anomalies or issues (e.g., security control deviations, threat environment changes, incidents impacting system risk level, security relevant changes, etc.). ([[CCI-000280]], [[CCI-000281]], [[CCI-001581]])
