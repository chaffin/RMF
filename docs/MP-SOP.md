# 3. APPLICABILITY 
This SOP is applicable to all Organizational elements and activities receiving support and services from the [Organization].

# 4. SCOPE  
This SOP extends to all government and contractor personnel as defined in section 6.a.(1) of this procedure. 

# 5. CONTROLS 
Certain controls and assessment procedures are covered at the DoD level allowing [Organization] the ability to inherit those controls through a common control provider. The Army has authorized and provided via the Army Policy Record the following common controls for Media Protection:  (CCI-002566, CCI-000995, CCI-000996, CCI-000999, CCI-001000, CCI-000998, CCI-000997, CCI-001002, CCI-001001, CCI-001004, CCI-001012, CCI-001013, CCI-001015, CCI-001016, CCI-001021, CCI-001022, CCI-002578, CCI-002579, CCI-001031, CCI-001033, CCI-002591).

<pcol-3>d) Document Control. Authorized personnel working in document control have physical access, while conducting their duties, to diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk, drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks, as well as non-digital media paper and film. (CCI-001005)

<pcol-1>b. (MP-3) Media Marking</div>

* c. (MP-4) Media Storage

** (1) All digital and non-digital media containing sensitive, controlled, and/or classified information are physically controlled and/or securely stored and protected until destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures as outlined in Reference (f) para. 8.0, and Reference (e) for NATO classified material. (CCI-001014, CCI-001018)

** (2) All digital and non-digital media containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are required to be maintained and handled in accordance with Reference (d). 

d. (MP-5) Media Transport 

(1) All digital and non-digital media containing sensitive, controlled, and/or classified information are protected during transport outside of controlled areas using the methods and techniques outlined within Reference (f) para. 6.0. (CCI-001020)

(2) Transporting media containing classified information are restricted to personnel who are authorized couriers as outlined in Reference (f) para. 6.1.1.2. (CCI-001024)

(3) Accountability for classified information system media during transport outside of controlled areas is maintained and documented in accordance with Reference (f) para. 6.1.1.3. (CCI-001023, CCI-001025)

e. (MP-5(3)) Media Transport - Custodians

(1) Custodians are not employed to transport information system media. Personnel who are authorized couriers are considered custodians responsible for the transport of classified information system media from pick-up to final delivery and receipt acknowledgement.  (CCI-001026)

f. (MP-5(4)) Media Transport - Cryptographic Protection

(1) The following tactics, techniques and procedures are employed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information stored on digital media during transport outside of controlled areas. (CCI-001027)

a) Microsoft Encrypting File System (EFS) is used for encryption of files on shared-use systems (i.e., where more than one user logs on and saves files).

b) Smartphones utilize a container-based encryption as employed by the vendor and managed by an enterprise solution (i.e., Blackberry Enterprise Server) is required.

g. (MP-6) Media Sanitization

(1) Media are protected commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information it contains prior to disposal. Before media are released out of organizational control or released for reuse, the media are sanitized by one or more methods outlined in Reference (h) for clearing, purging, and destroying. Items considered for maintenance/repair that contain media are sanitized as specified in Reference (g) utilizing sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. (CCI-001028, CCI-002580) 

h. (MP-6(1)) Media Sanitization – (Review, Approve, Track, Document, Verify)

k. (MP-7) Media Use

(1) There are media which have restrictions, and other media that are prohibited and never allowed to be used in any [Organization] information system. Both of these media have technical and nontechnical safeguards to prevent and/or restrict their use.

a) PROHIBITED MEDIA consists of USB thumb drives, memory sticks, flash drives, secure digital media, micro cards, and external media devices (e.g. cameras, phones, tablets, etc.) containing storage capability. This type of media is prohibited by this SOP as well as prevented from use by technical controls on [Organization] accredited information systems. 

b) RESTRICTED MEDIA consist of external USB hard disks/drives, optical disc (e.g., CD, DVD), and backup tapes/drives. This type of media is restricted by this SOP as well as technical controls on [Organization] accredited information systems.

1. All Restricted Media are restricted from being created on SIPR systems. The use of this type of media is "read only", and the creation by burning information onto optical disc media is restricted to those authorized and approved by the AO in Reference (i). 

2. External hard drives (i.e., portable storage devices) are considered a document under control and will have an assigned custodian by name as an identifiable owner responsible for the external hard drive.

3. Backup tapes and drives are considered documents under control and will have an assigned custodian by name. This type of media are restricted by use to privileged users of the Technical Operations group for the use of information system backups and storage.

(CCI-002585)

m. (MP-8) Media Downgrading

(1) Information system media downgrading is not authorized. [Organization] does not approved a downgrading process or implement any mechanisms to conduct media downgrading. There are no information system media identified requiring downgrading. All information system media are handled at the current and /or required security category and/or classification level until sanitized and/or destroyed. (CCI-002596, CCI-002597, CCI-002598, CCI-002599, CCI-002600, CCI-002587, CCI-002588, CCI-002589, CCI-002590, CCI-002594)
